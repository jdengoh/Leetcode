Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters <code>s</code>.

You must do this by modifying the input array <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm" target="_blank">in-place</a> with <code>O(1)</code> extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

**Constraints:**

- <code>1 <= s.length <= 10^5</code>
- <code>s[i]</code> is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters" target="_blank">printable ascii character</a>.
